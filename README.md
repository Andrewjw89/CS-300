Reflection:
	
//	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?:
	
	The problem I was solving in this course was how to identify the most efficient data structures for handling file based data and how to implement them correctly. This involved selecting structures that could support fast searches, sort output, and scale as the data set grows, while also analyzing their time and space complexity using Big-O notation to understand how each approach would perform as the number of courses increased.

//    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
	
	I approached the problem by analyzing and comparing different data structures to understand how their advantages and disadvantages impact program performance. It is important to understand data structures because each one handles data differently, and choosing the wrong structure can significantly increase runtime or limit functionality as a program scales. For this project, I evaluated vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees by considering their Big-O runtime for insertion, searching, and sorted output. This analysis helped me determine which structure would be most efficient and best suited for handling the course data and meeting the project requirements.
	
//    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

	One of the biggest roadblocks I encountered was correctly handling all of the different scenarios involved in binary search tree traversal and node deletion. I often missed a specific case at first, but by repeatedly practicing the implementation, I was able to develop a stronger and more solid understanding of the process.
	
//    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
	
	I think the work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by opening my eyes to how selecting the right data structures can directly impact the performance, scalability, and overall efficiency of my programs. It helped me move beyond simply making code work and instead think more carefully about how design decisions affect a program as it grows or handles more data.
	
//    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

	In this program, we broke down each process involved in inserting, deleting, and sorting data across different data structures, which made the program easier to read and maintain. We also focused on analyzing these data structures to determine which option would best support the program’s long-term scalability. Thinking ahead about these design choices is an important part of software development, and this course helped strengthen that skill for me
